For usage of the MATLAB files:

  -  File named "AAA" is the original version, without MEX.
  -  File named "AAA_mex" is the modified, MEX-ed version.

The "AAA" file runs with the original functions (e.g. F_estimate_p.m, Fast_ray_cast.m, etc). The MEX file runs with the mex-ed functions (e.g. mexRayCast.c, mexEstimateProb.c, etc). Make modifications accordingly and report them in this readme file.


CHANGELOG:
(Example: <In function "mexRayCast.c"> Change made in line <n>, in order to <reason>)
